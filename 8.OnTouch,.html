        <p>On Touch,
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="hover-trigger">
        toca-te a ti eu toquei-me, toco-me<br>
        em vez de ti. dou-te tudo menos o toque. esse é meu e é denso e é verdade.<br>
        a verdade é ver, o toque é nosso.
            <span class="hover-box">
            you touch yourself i touched me, i touch me/instead of you. i give you everything minus the touch. that one is mine and it is dense and it is true./ the truth is seeing, the touch is ours.
            </span>
        </span>touch appears to lose boundaries when not seen.<br>
        touch touch touch much better when not seen.<br>
        stop looking where you are going !! touch the gum on the floor,<br>
        you would only do it once anyways<br>
        there is need in needing,<br>
        but needing is not self-explanatory. not a gratuitous concept.<br>
        i need i need i need<br>
        i will count the i's in this text i consider prose,<br>
        and turn them to you.<br>
        would you sit in the same position if it brought you something you didn't know before.<br>
        have you seen the wall next to you it wants some contact.<br>
        leaning on a wall is safer than sitting on a chair.<br>
        when you read 'i need' i wonder what you think.<br>
        what do you not need i ask as well.<br>
        negatives carry more weight than positives.<br>
        cut yourself away from the image you'll see how lighter it feels.<br>
        but i do not suggest,<br>
        i give you my hand, yours won't be taken away if you hold on. (and i selfishly let you in)<br>
        i eat the hand. it is mine now (no punctuation)<br>
        ive used agency there for the first time,<br>
        agency is to not be paper, but putting on paper is a different story.<br>
        becoming the paper while having agency is the desire.<br>
        one on one perfect fit,<br>
        if you were a cup, and your insides would be water, do you think if someone poured you out,<br>
        when you'd come in again there would be enough space for the now two of you?<br>
        i touch myself as<br>
        i touch you<br>
        come inside, your fingers carry weight.<br>
        one finger is a body but you are as well<br>
        i give you mine<br>
        cut them off<br>
        no thought of touch without the means.<br>
        retract the means you'll find the end somehow.<br>
        i've reached it, with this document i retract.<br>
        i go backwards.<br>
        i find the means<br>
        touch touch touch<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        what is the point of contact if there is any at all<br>
        i ask. i ask you.<br>
        i have no answer for this, for the one i find is not bringing me pleasure.<br>
        i want the pleasure i seek to come from you.<br>
        too much work for it to be for me ( and it isn't i tell you)<br>
        <span class="hover-trigger">toca-me, toco-te eu a ti em vez<br>
                <span class="hover-box">
                touch me, i touch you and i to you instead
                </span>
            </span>
        in turn of the other i will step<br>
        no one comes forward<br>
        (really no one comes forward)<br>
        i will take your turn<br>
        i will be the weight and the paper<br>
