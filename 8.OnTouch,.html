        <br>toca-te a ti eu toquei-me, toco-me<br/>em vez de ti. dou-te tudo menos o toque. esse é meu e é denso e é verdade. a verdade é nossa,<br/>singular.<br/>a verdade é ver, o toque é nosso.TRANSLATION touch appears to lose boundaries when not seen. touch touch touch much better when not seen. stop looking where you are going !! touch the gum on the floor,<br/>you would only do it once anyways<br/>there is need in needing,<br/>but needing is not self-explanatory. not a gratuitous concept. i need i need i need<br/>i will count the i's in this text i consider prose,<br/>and turn them to you.<br/>would you sit in the same position if it brought you something you didn't know before.<br/>have you seen the wall next to you it wants some contact. leaning on a wall is safer than sitting on a chair.<br/>when you read 'i need' i wonder what you think. what do you not need i ask as well.<br/>negatives carry more weight than positives. cut yourself away from the image you'll see how lighter it feels. but i do not suggest,<br/>i give you my hand, yours won't be taken away if you hold on. (and i selfishly let you in)<br/>i eat the hand. it is mine now (no punctuation)<br/>ive used agency there for the first time,<br/>agency is to not be paper, but putting on paper is a different story. becoming the paper while having agency is the desire. one on one perfect fit,<br/>if you were a cup, and your insides would be water, do you think if someone poured you out, when you'd come in again there would be enough space for the now two of you?<br/>i touch myself as<br/>i touch you<br/>come inside, your fingers carry weight.<br/>one finger is a body but you are as well<br/>i give you mine<br/>cut them off<br/>no thought of touch without the means.<br/>retract the means you'll find the end somehow.<br/>i've reached it, with this document i retract. i go backwards. i find the means<br/>touch touch touch<br/> <br/> <br/>what is the point of contact if there is any at all<br/>i ask. i ask you.<br/>i have no answer for this, for the one i find is not bringing me pleasure.<br/>i want the pleasure i seek to come from you. too much work for it to be for me ( and it isn't i tell you)<br/>toca-me, toco-te eu a ti em vez<br/>in turn of the other i will step<br/>no one comes forward<br/>(really no one comes forward)<br/>i will take your turn<br/>i will be the weight and the paper<br/> <br/></p>
