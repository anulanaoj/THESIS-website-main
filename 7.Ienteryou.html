        <p>
            <br>looking for<br>
            <br>i’ve focused on shape<br>
            <br>i’d consider it as an outline. outlines carry weight in the seeing of things in the world.<br>
            <br>this was noticed with an increase of interest in poses, poses would re-appear. my body would return to known, i would think ‘ah what is this shape’. what do you think of calling a body, a shape?<br>
            <br>what do you think of calling yourself, form?<br>
            <br>i hope you do not interpret this as a derogatory question, do you call your body as you call a body of water?<br>
            <br>it is sometimes ok to be clear.<br>
            <br>i have started this search through questioning shape, and i have my body to reference. out of sometimes pure TRANSLATE teimosia. but i only have one pair of eyes.<br>
            <br>bodies make shapes.<br>
            <br>i traced the shapes on the notebook, the shape of the clothing i wore. my body was a negative with the environment.<br>
            <br>and i play around with it, as my body lost its weight. it is fun to play with shapes.<br>
            <br>the body is as a piece of paper is.<br>
            <br>i look at it as a reduction so i am only fooling this paper thing.<br>
            <br>but this gives me space to see myself as form, negative and a positive one, as a closed line nonetheless. i’d like to be undifferentiated as an open one.<br>
            <br>so i leaned on how to have a form is to have a body. the paper is a body.<br>
            <br>fabric is as well,<br>
            <br>i looked for form but form is accompanied.<br>
            <br>and a motionless body doesn’t sound so good.<br>
            <br>but i managed to turn it into stone, the fabric gave it breath.<br>
            <br>transferred from paper to cloth, i did this to some built and chewed already<br>
            <br>body of mine.<br>
            <br>chewchewchew eu masco-me<br>
            <br>eu como-me como uma goma,TRANSLATION1<br>
            <br>chewchewchew<br>
            <br>so then i wanted to make my form into a body of its own, it borrows from mine,<br>
            <br>i trace my leg with fabric, and staple it as to sew it. our skin is familiar to that of a pillow, we stuff ourselves<br>
            <br>and my leg is now an object, it furthered itself. stands away from me as my own does.´, something a drawn outline does in dreams<br>
            <br>but i still play, bend it like i can’t. when in space, one shape is many. it is not my leg anymore i must remember, it is also chewed, if not more.<br>
            <br>eu como-me como uma goma e faço-a contornar-me, TRANSLATION2<br>
            <br>as a cocoon built so i’d know where to live,<br>
            <br>it is inhabitable<br>
            <br>and i remember louise, my friend. she comes in thoughts,<br>
            <br>legs for days,<br>
            <br>i hope i get to keep them afterwards.<br>
            <br>first person perspective of unseeable volume,<br>
            <br>sounds a religious sentence.<br>
            <br>let me bear one of yours so i step away and see as i am.<br>
            <br>a selfish one for christianity<br>
            <br>i try drawing what i sense,<br>
            <br>i sense odd proportionality, i sense the edge of my back, unseeable,<br>
            <br>i see it as i sense it bigger. volume is a tricky thing to have an idea of when you go from touch. my legs are no point of reference if i am blind.<br>
            <br>ah the internal world remains far, as i created images ah.<br>
            <br>there is no world to show, i’ll tell it as it is,<br>
            <br>the outlines give me so<br>
            <br>but if you wish to see me, do not look here<br>
            <br>as i have lied<br>
            <br>tracing myself, i trace you as well.<br>
            <br>do you see you as you see me?<br>
            <br>i trace myself so i touch what touches me and hope some clarity,<br>
            <br>delusional as it may,<br>
