        <div class="text">   Travelling to school, I saw landscapes while inside the closed car with the glass of the window as a separator of us both. The landscape is made of, in the first plane, just the road, grey and strict. It then contrasts with the remaining planes- of grass, trees and mountains, green that can make you think you are predestined to only see one colour for the rest of your days. So much green you forget there is a sky.
              The sky is usually grey. The island welcomes an agglomerate of clouds which sometimes come down to say hello and confirm themselves by touching us in the skin. I’ve always had the desire to escape the car, open the door unharmed and go go go to the mountains. They appear closer than they are. Wanting to go there and hug the grass face down and breathe in the remaining drops left by humidity of the previous day’s rain.
              The feeling of embeddedness is translatable to that of the characteristic humidity of the island – orange is everywhere. Humidity affects our sense-hood, ingrains itself in our bones, gives us headaches. It is as some entity has entered us. It is as glue which un-differentiates the body from its surroundings. It limits felt distance to the environment because it embeds itself on anything inserted in said environment. A homogeneous being it is.
